        	<p>im unknownversion, or unkver for short. i know a bit about programming and i like using my camera from 2007. my music taste is horrible, and i know <i>too much</i> about linux.</p>
        	<p>i'm not a fan of the idea to completely rape my website with css, so don't be suprised that this piece of the world wide web looks like this (at least the contents display correctly on every single screen size possible, so its cool that i dont have to do some css/js fuckery in order for your wittwe phone screen to correctly display divs and shit)</p>
        	<p>feel free to contact me on discord (where you probably found this exact link) or at unknownversion@tutamail.com</p>
